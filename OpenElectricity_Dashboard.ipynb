    "This notebook runs the Dash dashboard from `mtqq_dashboard_dash.py` for visualizing real-time electricity data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use:**\n",
    "1. Make sure the MQTT publisher is running (Assignment_2.ipynb)\n",
    "2. Run the cells below to start the dashboard\n",
    "3. Access the dashboard at: **http://localhost:8052**\n",
    "4. The dashboard runs on port 8052 (different from mtqq_dashboard.py which uses 8051)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "- Real-time data integration from MQTT\n",
    "- Interactive map with filtering by region and fuel type\n",
    "- View modes: Power, Emissions, Demand, Price\n",
    "- Automatic refresh every 8 seconds\n",
    "- **NEW:** Stop function - no need to restart kernel!"
